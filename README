Timesheet2invoice reads from an Anuko Timetracker database and creates
a GnuCash invoice for the work done.  Saves entering data twice and avoids
mistakes &| mis-matches in your timesheets - Invoices.

Edit the db_conf.cfg.example and remove the "sample" part to suit your 
database, filesystem, karmic resonance etc.

It is possibly dangerous to use as it can create mutiple invoices for the
same work.  Invoices can be recycled in GnuCash however, so all is not lost if
you run this twice for the same time period.  There is a primitive check
for duplicate runs in that it checks for the presence of a csv file, created
at each run.  If the file exists then it quits with a message.  This doesn't
cover the cases where there are weekly and monthly invoices that have 
overlapping entries.  That's up to the user to check and be consistent in
whether invoices are produced weekly or monthly.  The default is weekly.

To run for a month append month_number and "m" to the command line like:
./timesheet2invoice 4 m

The config file (db_conf.cfg) resides in the same directory as the 
application, else hack the source if different.

I'm sure this could be adapted to suit other timsheet databases.  Fork and
hack at your leasure.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE
Test extensively on a COPY of your account file.  I will not be resposible 
for data loss, corruption of any sort by your use of this software.  

You have been warned.
