Timesheet2invoice reads from an Anuko Timetracker database and creates
a GnuCash invoice for the work done.

It is possibly dangerous to use as it can create mutiple invoices for the
same work.  Invoices can be recycled in GnuCash however, so all is not lost if
you run this twice for the same time period.

I'm sure this could be adapted to suit other timsheet databases.
